Create teams in your organization
##################################################

You can create teams in your organization. Teams are especially useful when:

* Limit visibility to a project to a certain team, instead of the whole organization
* Allow certain environments to be used only by a specific team

Create a team
----------------

* Login to `app.valohai.com <https://app.valohai.com>`_
* Click on **Hi, <username>!** on the top right corner
* Select **Manage <organization>**
* Open the **Teams** tab
* On the right side add a new team name and click **Create team**

Add users to a team
----------------------

Once a team is created you can open it by clicking the link on the **Teams** table.

Use the dropdown under **Members** to select the user who you want to add to the team and click **Add member**.
