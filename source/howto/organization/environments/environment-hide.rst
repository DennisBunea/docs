    :description: Hide environments from users


Choose which environments are available
##################################################

Valohai allows you to run executions either on Valohai owned environments, or your own environments. These environments can be either in the cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premises.

You might for example want to hide Valohai owned environments from your users, or allow users to use only environments in a certain cloud provider region.

To restrict environment access:

* Login to `app.valohai.com <https://app.valohai.com>`_
* Click on **Hi, <username>!** on the top right corner
* Select **Manage <organization>**
* Open the Settings tab
* Click on the **Restrict environment access** checkbox
* Select all the environments you'd like to have available to your users from the drop-down menu.
