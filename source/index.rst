Valohai Documentation
=====================

Welcome to the Valohai documentation!

Valohai is a machine learning platform. It can run your experiments
locally and in the cloud. The platform also tracks your experiment
history and enables collaboration between members in a machine learning
team.

Everything in Valohai begins with the ``valohai.yaml`` configuration
file. It is recommended that you read through the different parts of the
configuration to understand the core concepts of the Valohai platform.
