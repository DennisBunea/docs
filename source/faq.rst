Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How to define that my execution failed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The individual command is considered to be successful if it returns error code 0. This is the standard
convention for most programs and operating systems.

Valohai will mark an execution as a failure if *the last* commands returns any other code than 0.

The best approach to communicate what went wrong is to use stderr which is visible on the execution **Logs** tab.

How to pass command parameters in ``Rscript myscript.r arg1 arg2`` format?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You define how the parameters are passed in the ``parameters`` section in ``valohai.yaml``.

The default syntax is ``--{name}={value}`` so:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - name: dropout
     pass-as: '--dropout={v}'

To achieve the syntax mentioned in the question, add or modify the ``pass-as`` property:

.. code-block:: yaml

   - name: dropout
     pass-as: '{v}'

See the :doc:`valohai.yaml documentation </valohai-yaml>` for more details.

How do I upload files from my executions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anything written to the ``/valohai/outputs`` directory will be uploaded and accessible after the execution.

The files are uploaded into a user-specific section of our AWS S3 bucket by default, but you can customize this.
