You can use the ``datum://<identifier>`` syntax to refer to specific files Valohai platform already knows about.

Files will have a datum URL if the files were uploaded to Valohai either:

1) as outputs from another execution
2) or using the Valohai web interface uploader under "Data" tab of the project

You can find the datum URL by clicking the "datum://" button under "Data" tab of the project.
