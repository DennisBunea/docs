Quick Start - Hosted Jupyter Notebooks (MNIST)
=====================================================

In this tutorial, we will use the Valohai Hosted Notebooks to build a machine learning model
using the MNIST dataset.

Create a new Notebook instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Navigate to the Notebooks tab of your project and click on `Create notebook` to create a new instance.
* Give the instance a title and choose your commit version. Currently all Valohai Hosted Notebooks are created in Microsoft Azure in West Europe.
* Once the instance is up and running you'll be able to connect to it.

    **Notebook instances are not permanent**

    Keep in mind that Valohai Hosted Notebooks are shut down after 12 hours, if they are not being used. Valohai does not automatically save all the changes in your Notebook but allows you to continue
