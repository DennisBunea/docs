    :description: What is valohai.yaml? Make your deep learning workflows reproducible with Valohai YAML standard.

Valohai YAML
##############

Each Valohai-enabled git repository has a ``valohai.yaml`` **configuration file** that defines the runs that can be executed and what kind of REST endpoints can be automatically generated by the project. We'll cover these execution types or "steps", as we call them, in the next section.

A single configuration file can be used by multiple projects by various users, as long as the user has access to the git repository.

Example of a ``valohai.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # This step downloads a set of images
    # and runs preprocess.py
    - step:
        name: Preprocess dataset (MNIST)
        image: tensorflow/tensorflow:1.13.1-py3
        command: python preprocess.py
        inputs:
          - name: training-set-images
            default: https://valohaidemo.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/imgages.tar.gz

    # This step downloads preprocessed-data
    # and runs train.py with two parameters (max_steps and learning_rate)
    - step:
        name: Train model
        image: tensorflow/tensorflow:1.13.1-py3
        command: python train.py {parameters}
        parameters:
          - name: max_steps
            type: integer
            default: 300
          - name: learning_rate
            type: float
            default: 0.001
        inputs:
          - name: preprocessed-data
            default: https://valohaidemo.blob.core.windows.net/mnist/data.tar.gz

    # This step downloads a trained model file and images,
    # installs libraries listed in requirements.txt
    # and runs batch_inference.py
    - step:
        name: Batch inference
        image: tensorflow/tensorflow:1.13.1-py3
        command:
          - pip install -r requirements.txt
          - python batch_inference.py
        inputs:
          - name: model
          - name: images

.. tip::

    Python users can use ``valohai-utils`` to define Valohai steps in their code, and then run ``vh yaml step myfile.py`` to generate the YAML file.

Large YAML files
--------------------

Each Project can have one ``valohai.yaml`` file. As your project grows, you might start having repetitive content in your YAML file.

We recommend using  `YAML anchors <https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2765878>`_, aliases, and extensions to define and re-use repeatitive content.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:
    :emphasize-lines: 2,20

    - definitions:
        my-inputs: &my_inputs
            - name: test-set
              keep-directories: suffix
              default: s3://onboard-sample/test/*
            - name: train-set
              keep-directories: suffix
              default: s3://onboard-sample/train/*

    - step:
        name: train-model
        image: tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.1
        command:
          - pip install valohai-utils numpy
          - python ./train.py {parameters}
        parameters:
          - name: epoch
            default: 5
            type: integer
        inputs: *my_inputs
