``step.name``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``name`` property gives the step a human-readable name to be shown everywhere.

It can have spaces but we do recommend using ``dash-separated-lowercase`` so it can be written without quoting
in the command-line client.

That is pretty much there is to the name ;)
