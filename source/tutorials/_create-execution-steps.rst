1. Go to the **Executions** tab inside your project
2. Press the **Create execution** button
3. The ``Step`` field lists all available types of executions. Make sure |example-step-name| is selected.
4. You don't need to worry about the rest of the configuration for now.
   The default inputs and parameters of the form are loaded from the ``valohai.yaml`` configuration file
   and should be good for this example execution.
5. Press **Submit** to start the execution.
