Common Docker Images
====================

Valohai utilizes Docker images to package your dependencies. This means that the platform is capable of running any code from C to Python as long as it can run inside a Docker container.

You can use any Docker image accessible through the Internet or :doc:`build your own </guides/build-docker-image/index>`.

We recommend hosting your images on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ but you can use any Docker repository.
