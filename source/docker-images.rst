Docker Images
=============

You can use any Docker images to package your dependencies. So Valohai platform is capable to run any kind of code from C to Python as long as it runs inside a predefined Docker container.

We recommend hosting your images on `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_ but you can use any Docker repository.
