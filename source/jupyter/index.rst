``Jupyhai`` - Jupyter Notebooks with Valohai
============================================

**Jupyhai** is a Jupyter notebook extension developed and maintained by Valohai.
It enables you to use Jupyter notebooks easily with the Valohai platform.
It is an optional way of interacting with projects in the same capacity as our web user interface, API and command-line client.

Go through our :doc:`/quickstarts/quick-start-jupyter/index` tutorial to see the extension in action.
