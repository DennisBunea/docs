    :description: What are Valohai projects? Create a context where to work and collaborate on deep learning problems.

Projects
========

You work and collaborate on **projects**; a project is a space for tackling a specific machine learning problem or domain.
If you have used GitHub, projects in Valohai are a lot like code repositories.

A project is linked to a remote git repository. You can use any git hosting service, not just GitHub but also e.g. BitBucket and GitLab.

These linked repositories define what kind of "runs" can be executed in the context of that project
using the :doc:`valohai.yaml configuration file </valohai-yaml/index>`.

Here are more in-depth example repositories which have ``valohai.yaml`` defined:

* https://github.com/valohai/tensorflow-example
* https://github.com/valohai/keras-example
* https://github.com/valohai/darknet-example
* https://github.com/valohai/cntk-example
* https://github.com/valohai/r-example
* https://github.com/valohai/mxnet-example
* https://github.com/valohai/integration-example

We also have `quick start tutorials </tutorials>`_ to get you started right away.

Iterative experimentation is also supported using our ``vh`` command-line client, try out :doc:`our quick start command-line client tutorial </quickstarts/quick-start-cli>` to get a taste how it works.
