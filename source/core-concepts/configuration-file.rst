    :description: What is valohai.yaml? Make your deep learning workflows reproducible with Valohai YAML standard.

``valohai.yaml``
================

Each Valohai-enabled git repository has a ``valohai.yaml`` **configuration file** that defines the runs that can be executed and what kind of REST endpoints can be automatically generated by the project. We'll cover these execution types or "steps", as we call them, in the next section.

A single configuration file can be used by multiple projects by various users, as long as the user has access to the git repository.
